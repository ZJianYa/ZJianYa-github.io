# 8.12 Selecting Optimizer Features to Trace

Some features in the optimizer can be invoked many times during statement optimization and execution, and thus can make the trace grow beyond reason. They are:  

在语句优化和执行期间，优化程序中的某些功能可以被多次调用，从而使跟踪超出了合理范围。他们是：

* Greedy search: with a N-table join, this could explore factorial(N) plans  
  贪婪搜索：使用N表联接，这可以探索阶乘（N） plans  
* Range optimizer  
  范围优化器
* Dynamic range optimization (known as "range checked for each record" in EXPLAIN output: each outer row causes a re-run of the range optimizer)  
  动态范围优化（在 EXPLAIN 输出中称为 "range checked for each record"：每个外部(循环)行都会重新运行范围优化器）
* Subqueries: a subquery in WHERE clause may be executed once per row.  
  子查询：WHERE子句中的子查询可以每行执行一次。

Those features can be excluded from tracing using the optimizer_trace_features system variable, which has these on/off switches:  
可以使用 optimizer_trace_features 系统变量从跟踪中排除这些功能，该系统变量具有以下 on / off 开关：  

* greedy_search: if off, greedy search is not traced
* range_optimizer: if off, range optimizer is not traced
* dynamic_range: if off, only the first call to the range optimizer on this JOIN_TAB::SQL_SELECT is traced
* repeated_subselect: if off, only the first execution of this Item_subselect is traced.
