If a JSON structure is large, it's difficult to pair its closing bracket with its opening bracket; to help the reader (but this is not JSON-compliant), setting @@end_markers_in_json=on repeats the structure's key (if it has one) near the closing bracket. It also affects 'EXPLAIN FORMAT=JSON' in the same way. Note that before MySQL 5.6.6, this variable didn't exist and was rather a switch in the @@optimizer_trace variable (it was set with 'set optimizer_trace="end_marker=on";').

如果JSON结构很大，则很难将其右括号和左括号配对；为了帮助读者（但这不兼容JSON），设置@@ end_markers_in_json = on会在右括号附近重复该结构的键（如果有）。它也以相同的方式影响“ EXPLAIN FORMAT = JSON”。请注意，在MySQL 5.6.6之前，此变量不存在，而只是@@ optimizer_trace变量中的一个开关（已使用“ setoptimizer_trace =“ end_marker = on”;“设置）。
