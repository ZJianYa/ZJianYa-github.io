# 13.2.13 WITH Syntax (Common Table Expressions)

A common table expression (CTE) is a named temporary result set that exists within the scope of a single statement and that can be referred to later within that statement, possibly multiple times. The following discussion describes how to write statements that use CTEs.

公用表表达式（CTE）是一个命名的临时结果集，它存在于单个语句的范围内，并且可以在该语句中稍后引用，可能多次。以下讨论描述了如何编写使用CTE的语句。

## Common Table Expression Syntax

To specify common table expressions, use a WITH clause that has one or more comma-separated subclauses. Each subclause provides a subquery that produces a result set, and associates a name with the subquery. The following example defines CTEs named cte1 and cte2 in the WITH clause, and refers to them in the top-level SELECT that follows the WITH clause:

要指定公用表表达式，请使用 WITH具有一个或多个逗号分隔子句的子句。每个子subclause都提供一个子查询用于生成结果集，并将名称与子查询相关联。下面的示例定义名为的CTE cte1和cte2中 WITH子句，并且是指在它们的顶层SELECT下面的WITH子句：

```{}
WITH
  cte1 AS (SELECT a, b FROM table1),
  cte2 AS (SELECT c, d FROM table2)
SELECT b, d FROM cte1 JOIN cte2
WHERE cte1.a = cte2.c;
```

In the statement containing the WITH clause, each CTE name can be referenced to access the corresponding CTE result set.  
在包含该WITH子句的语句中,每个CTE结果集有一个CTE名称。

A CTE name can be referenced in other CTEs, enabling CTEs to be defined based on other CTEs.

每个CTE名称可以被其他CTEs使用，即可以基于其他CTE来定义一个新的CTE。

A CTE can refer to itself to define a recursive CTE. Common applications of recursive CTEs include series generation and traversal of hierarchical or tree-structured data.

一个CTE可以引用自身来定义递归CTE。递归CTE的常见应用包括分层或树状结构数据的序列生成和遍历。

Common table expressions are an optional part of the syntax for DML statements. They are defined using a WITH clause:

公用表表达式是DML语句语法的可选部分。它们使用以下WITH子句定义 ：

```{}
with_clause:
    WITH [RECURSIVE]
        cte_name [(col_name [, col_name] ...)] AS (subquery)
        [, cte_name [(col_name [, col_name] ...)] AS (subquery)] ...
```

cte_name names a single common table expression and can be used as a table reference in the statement containing the WITH clause.

cte_name命名单个公用表表达式，可以在WITH语句中使用。

The subquery part of AS (subquery) is called the “subquery of the CTE” and is what produces the CTE result set. The parentheses following AS are required.

这subquery部分被称为 “ CTE的子查询 ”，AS后面的括号是必需的。

A common table expression is recursive if its subquery refers to its own name. The RECURSIVE keyword must be included if any CTE in the WITH clause is recursive. For more information, see Recursive Common Table Expressions.

如果公用表表达式的子查询引用自己的名称，则表达式是递归的。该RECURSIVE关键字必须被包含，如果任何的CTE的WITH 条款是递归的。有关更多信息，请参阅 递归公用表表达式。

Determination of column names for a given CTE occurs as follows:

- If a parenthesized list of names follows the CTE name, those names are the column names:

```{}
WITH cte (col1, col2) AS
(
  SELECT 1, 2
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 3, 4
)
SELECT col1, col2 FROM cte;
```

The number of names in the list must be the same as the number of columns in the result set.

- Otherwise, the column names come from the select list of the first SELECT within the AS (subquery) part:

```{}
WITH cte AS
(
  SELECT 1 AS col1, 2 AS col2
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 3, 4
)
SELECT col1, col2 FROM cte;
```

......

## Recursive Common Table Expressions

A recursive common table expression is one having a subquery that refers to its own name. For example:

```{}
WITH RECURSIVE cte (n) AS
(
  SELECT 1
  UNION ALL
  SELECT n + 1 FROM cte WHERE n < 5
)
SELECT * FROM cte;
```

When executed, the statement produces this result, a single column containing a simple linear sequence:

```{}
+------+
| n    |
+------+
|    1 |
|    2 |
|    3 |
|    4 |
|    5 |
+------+
```

A recursive CTE has this structure:

- The WITH clause must begin with WITH RECURSIVE if any CTE in the WITH clause refers to itself. (If no CTE refers to itself, RECURSIVE is permitted but not required.)

If you forget RECURSIVE for a recursive CTE, this error is a likely result:

```{}
ERROR 1146 (42S02): Table 'cte_name' doesn't exist
```

- The recursive CTE subquery has two parts, separated by UNION [ALL] or UNION DISTINCT:

```{}
SELECT ...      -- return initial row set
UNION ALL
SELECT ...      -- return additional row sets
```

The first SELECT produces the initial row or rows for the CTE and does not refer to the CTE name. The second SELECT produces additional rows and recurses by referring to the CTE name in its FROM clause. Recursion ends when this part produces no new rows. Thus, a recursive CTE consists of a nonrecursive SELECT part followed by a recursive SELECT part.

Each SELECT part can itself be a union of multiple SELECT statements.
