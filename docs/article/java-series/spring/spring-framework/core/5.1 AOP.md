# 5. Aspect Oriented Programming with Spring

## 5.1. Introduction

Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) complements Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by providing another way of thinking about program structure. The key unit of modularity in OOP is the class, whereas in AOP the unit of modularity is the aspect. Aspects enable the modularization of concerns such as transaction management that cut across multiple types and objects. (Such concerns are often termed crosscutting concerns in AOP literature.)

面向方面编程（AOP）通过提供另一种思考程序结构的方式来补充面向对象编程（OOP）。OOP中模块化的关键单元是类，而在AOP中，模块化单元是方面。方面实现了诸如跨越多种类型和对象的事务管理之类的关注点的模块化。（这种 concerns 通常被称为AOP文献中的横切关注点。）

One of the key components of Spring is the AOP framework. While the Spring IoC container does not depend on AOP, meaning you do not need to use AOP if you don’t want to, AOP complements Spring IoC to provide a very capable middleware solution.

Spring的一个关键组件是AOP框架。虽然Spring IoC容器不依赖于AOP，但是如果您不想使用AOP，则意味着您不需要使用AOP，AOP补充了Spring IoC以提供非常强大的中间件解决方案。

>Spring 2.0 introduced a simpler and more powerful way of writing custom aspects using either a schema-based approach or the @AspectJ annotation style. Both of these styles offer fully typed advice and use of the AspectJ pointcut language, while still using Spring AOP for weaving.

>Spring 2.0引入了一种使用基于模式的方法或@AspectJ注释样式编写自定义方面的更简单，更强大的方法。这两种样式都提供完全类型的建议和AspectJ切入点语言的使用，同时仍然使用Spring AOP进行编织。

>The Spring 2.0+ schema- and @AspectJ-based AOP support is discussed in this chapter. The lower-level AOP support, as commonly exposed in Spring 1.2 applications, is discussed in [the following chapter](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.0.x/spring-framework-reference/core.html#aop-api).

>本章将讨论Spring 2.0+模式和基于@ AspectJ的AOP支持。下一章将讨论较低级别的AOP支持，如Spring 1.2应用程序中常见的那样。

AOP is used in the Spring Framework to…​

- …​ provide declarative enterprise services, especially as a replacement for EJB declarative services. The most important such service is declarative transaction management.  
用于事务

- …​ allow users to implement custom aspects, complementing their use of OOP with AOP.  
用于OOP？

>If you are interested only in generic declarative services or other pre-packaged declarative middleware services such as pooling, you do not need to work directly with Spring AOP, and can skip most of this chapter.
>如果您只对通用声明性服务或其他预先打包的声明性中间件服务（如池）感兴趣，则无需直接使用Spring AOP，并且可以跳过本章的大部分内容。

### 5.1.1. AOP concepts

Let us begin by defining some central AOP concepts and terminology. These terms are not Spring-specific…​ unfortunately, AOP terminology is not particularly intuitive; however, it would be even more confusing if Spring used its own terminology.

让我们首先定义一些中心AOP概念和术语。这些术语不是特定于Spring的......不幸的是，AOP术语不是特别直观; 但是，如果Spring使用自己的术语，那将更加令人困惑。

- Aspect: a modularization of a concern that cuts across multiple classes. Transaction management is a good example of a crosscutting concern in enterprise Java applications. In Spring AOP, aspects are implemented using regular classes (the schema-based approach) or regular classes annotated with the @Aspect annotation (the @AspectJ style).  
切面，我更愿意称之为刀片。  

- Join point: a point during the execution of a program, such as the execution of a method or the handling of an exception. In Spring AOP, a join point always represents a method execution.  
连接点：程序执行期间的一个点，例如方法的执行或异常的处理。在Spring AOP中，连接点始终表示方法执行。  

- Advice: action taken by an aspect at a particular join point. Different types of advice include "around", "before" and "after" advice. (Advice types are discussed below.) Many AOP frameworks, including Spring, model an advice as an interceptor, maintaining a chain of interceptors around the join point.  
Advice：某个方面在特定连接点采取的操作（我更愿意称之为切法，我是上面切，还是下面切，还是一刀两断的切，还是异常之后再切）。不同类型的 advice 包括“around”，“before”和“after”建议。（建议类型将在下面讨论。）许多AOP框架（包括Spring）将建议建模为拦截器，在连接点周围维护一系列拦截器。  

- Pointcut: a predicate that matches join points. Advice is associated with a pointcut expression and runs at any join point matched by the pointcut (for example, the execution of a method with a certain name). The concept of join points as matched by pointcut expressions is central to AOP, and Spring uses the AspectJ pointcut expression language by default.  
匹配连接点的谓词。Advice 与切入点表达式相关联，并在切入点匹配的任何连接点处运行（例如，执行具有特定名称的方法）。由切入点表达式匹配的连接点的概念是AOP的核心，Spring默认使用AspectJ切入点表达式语言。

- Introduction: declaring additional methods or fields on behalf of a type. Spring AOP allows you to introduce new interfaces (and a corresponding implementation) to any advised object. For example, you could use an introduction to make a bean implement an IsModified interface, to simplify caching. (An introduction is known as an inter-type declaration in the AspectJ community.)   
？？？？

- Target object: object being advised by one or more aspects. Also referred to as the advised object. Since Spring AOP is implemented using runtime proxies, this object will always be a proxied object.  
被代理对象。  

- AOP proxy: an object created by the AOP framework in order to implement the aspect contracts (advise method executions and so on). In the Spring Framework, an AOP proxy will be a JDK dynamic proxy or a CGLIB proxy.  
相当于 agent 。在`Spring Framework`中，一个 AOP proxy 是 JDK 动态代理或者 CGLIB 代理。

- Weaving: linking aspects with other application types or objects to create an advised object. This can be done at compile time (using the AspectJ compiler, for example), load time, or at runtime. Spring AOP, like other pure Java AOP frameworks, performs weaving at runtime.  
  实现切面，有些是编译时，有些是运行时。
