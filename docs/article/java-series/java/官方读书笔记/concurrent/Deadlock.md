# Deadlock

Deadlock describes a situation where two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other. Here's an example.

死锁描述了两个或多个线程永远被阻塞，等待彼此的情况。这是一个例子.

Alphonse and Gaston are friends, and great believers in courtesy. A strict rule of courtesy is that when you bow to a friend, you must remain bowed until your friend has a chance to return the bow. Unfortunately, this rule does not account for the possibility that two friends might bow to each other at the same time. This example application, Deadlock, models this possibility:

阿方斯和加斯顿是朋友，也很有礼貌的信徒。严格的礼貌规则是，当你向朋友鞠躬时，你必须保持鞠躬，直到你的朋友有机会还躬。不幸的是，这条规则没有考虑到两个朋友可能同时互相鞠躬的可能性。这个示例应用程序 Deadlock模拟了这种可能性：
